            <h3> From ADIA to UIN </h3>
            <p>The Faculty of Adab and Humanities (FAH) of UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta was established on June 1, 1957 as part of the Academy of Religious Sciences (ADIA) which was also established at the same time. At that time there were only two faculties, namely the Faculty of Adab and Humanities and the Faculty of Tarbiyah Science. This refers to the Decree of the Minister of Religious Affairs Number 1 of 1957. The Faculty of Adab and Humanities became a faculty when ADIA transformed into a State Islamic Institute (IAIN) in 1960 through Decree of the Minister of Religious Affairs No. 35 of 1960 under the name Faculty of Adab. At that time, Prof. Dr. Bustami Abdul Gani became the first Dean. Subsequently, the Faculty of Adab and Humanities, which was only called the Faculty of Adab, changed its name as stated in the current nomenclature after IAIN experienced a change in mandate to become a State Islamic University (UIN) in accordance with Presidential Decree No. 031 dated May 20, 2002.</p>
